# The First Part of the project

This project investigates the transferability of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformer-based models. We will train both model types on the Describable Textures Dataset (DTD) and fine-tune them on the RSSCN7 dataset. Additionally, we will compare their performance with pretrained models from ImageNet and apply eXplainable AI (XAI) methods to interpret model decisions.

# The Second Part of the project

This part of the project was described in detail in the Presentations-Report/TransferLearning_ResearchProposal.pdf

To make a long story short, we decided to explore curriculum learning (self-paced method and with manual division of images into 3 parts) on Resnet18.
